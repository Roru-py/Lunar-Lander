This repository contains 2 models which implement **A2C or Advantage actor critic** method of RL to a **box2D environment** form the gymnasium package.
Initial model has some issues which have been corrected by using better feature vector and different learning rates in the code.

The code requires a virtual env containing the required libraries and the Box-2D environment to run which I am not uploading due to github restrictions.
This project features my knowledge of A2C algorithm of reinforcement learning which is part of one of the most crucial algorithms used in the modern time. This algorithm is directly available in libraries like Pytorch but this project features my own implementation of it.
